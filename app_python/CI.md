# CI best practices

1. Automate Everything. Automate build, test, and deployment processes.
2. Comprehensive Testing. Run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
3. Code Quality Checks. Using static code analysis tools (ESLint for frontend for example). 
Enforce code formatting with automated tools (e.g., Prettier for frontend, Black for python applications).
4. Isolated Environments. Using containerization for consistent environments. Avoid reliance on local machine configurations.

## Moscow Time Web Application

## Framework Choice

I choose React Typescript framework to implement client web application.
React is the most popular framework for frontend development.
I use bundler Vite for my application with default settings.

## Applied best practices

I follow KISS and DRY best practises in my code every time.
I make responsive layout for web application.
Also, I use eslint for linting.

## Testing

First, I run the application and test manually.
I refresh page several times to ensure that time displays correctly.
Also, I check dev tools.
I see that layout is responsive, and page looks good in different devices and sizes.
I verify that the time displayed is accurate according to Moscow's timezone.
